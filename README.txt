FormiFlow is a process management software for Public Administration created by José Antonio Rivero García Saavedra.

With this software, administrative processes can be designed very easily by drawing a task flowchart and assigning to each task the information required by the task executor and the information needed to complete it, including data inserted into other tasks. This allows for great agility in both process design and execution.

Users can begin using it by creating tasks and linking them with the buttons in the main menu, located under the header. Right-clicking on a task allows you to configure the necessary information and the information to be provided for the task. Double-clicking on a task displays the information needed for task execution.

The software is programmed in Javascript, and the version published here manually loads and saves data files in paths, although it will not be difficult for you to modify it to load and save information in a client-server system (always within the license restrictions that can be consulted in the software itself).
